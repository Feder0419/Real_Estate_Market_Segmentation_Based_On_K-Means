# Real_Estate_Market_Segmentation_Based_On_K-Means
A segmentation model for Wuhan's (Hubei, China) housing market using 6,000+ transaction records.

## Description
- This project is based on 6154 housing market transaction records from web scraping in March 2024. By selecting the average market price as a feature variable to segment the real estate market, this project explores the application of the K-means clustering model in real estate market segmentation. Furthermore, a price–coordinate separation model based on K-means is proposed for spatial partitioning. The results indicate that the K-means–based price–coordinate separation model provides an effective approach for real estate market segmentation.
- Using normalized mutual information (NMI), the results of the proposed model are compared with both the existing zoning divisions in Wuhan’s “Real Estate Market Regional Sector Classification” and the traditional Kriging interpolation method, verifying the model’s validity and practicality.
- The K-means–based price–coordinate separation model, as a machine learning approach, holds significant importance for real estate market analysis and management, and can be applied to tasks such as supply–demand zone evaluation and land grading and classification, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of related work.
- This project also tried edge detection and K-means based on PCA dimensionality reduction, though their results are not satisfying.
